# Summary

The precise analysis of geological samples is crucial for understanding the history of Earths formation, identification of mineral deposits, age dating, paleoclimatology and more [@Chew:2021]. Laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) has become one of the most common analytical techniques for the chemical analysis of such geological samples by measuring elemental composition upon ablation of target areas, often performed on mineral grains within the micron scale [@George:2018; @YAO:2017; @Rebecca:2018]. Accurate recording of laser ablation targets is important for reproducibility, ensuring that collected data is matched to its target location. Annotation of laser ablation targets or Regions Of Interest (ROI) for laser ablated samples can be mapped onto high resolution Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) images, which are often used for mineral characterisation [@Rebecca:2018; @Bonnetti:2020]. This was originally a manual process for many laboratories, thus could lead to inaccurate labelling which impedes reproducibility and compromises important studies.

# Existing Solutions

There exists tools for the annotation of geological samples and integration with laser ablation systems, however they all have varying functionality, accessibility and ease of use (\autoref{tab:table1}).

|Software|Description|Access|
|---|---|---|
|GeoStar Î¼GIS TM [@Geostar]|Manual and automatic sample point selection. Image importation from any source such as SEM. Integration with ICP-MS systems and automatic instrument control.|Proprietary software package written for use in RESOlution instruments and requires a paid license.|
|ImageJ (FIJI) [@ImageJ]|Many available plugins and features allow customization of the software to perform a variety of tasks.|Free and open source.|
|Quartz PCI [@QuartzPCI]|PCI allows for SEM image annotation and measurement of features.|Requires a paid license.|
|uScope Navigator [@uScopeNavigator]|Capable of image processing such as gamma, contrast and bilateral smoothing filters in addition to ROI annotation. May not be compatible with all laser ablation systems.|Requires a paid license/ comes with their microscope systems.|
|MIPAR [@MIPAR]|Capable of analysing SEM images and creating annotations with locations recorded.|Requires a paid license.|

Many of the existing paid software solutions are efficient, but the fact that they are paid for restricts their use within the community, both financially and through dependency on their systems in the case of proprietary software. Moreover, ImageJ is free and provides a range of customization options, but the complexity of this customization requires specialist time investment, making it difficult for those with less computational experience. This leaves a gap in the market for a simple, accessible, and free to use solution, which enables efficient laser ablation workflows. In this body of work, we introduce our software, TACtool, to fill this gap.

# Statement of Need

TACtool (Targeting And Coordination tool) enables users to annotate laser ablation shots onto high resolution SEM images. TACtool automatically calculates coordinates of annotations which can be uploaded to laser ablation systems, ensuring efficient and accurate recording. This automatic process additionally saves time, lab resources, and therefore money when identifying ROI. TACtool also provides optional metadata recording for every ROI which further improves reproducibility and traceability throughout a lab's workflow.

The intuitive and accessible front-end design of TACtool allows users with a lack of computational experience to easily record their annotations, especially because the software can be downloaded as a compiled program, mitigating the need to setup complex development environments. This simplicity continues throughout the workflow within TACtool, as users can import an image file onto a canvas, before clicking directly onto that image to add their ROI and respective annotations. The coordinates and metadata for each ROI can be exported to a plain text Comma-Separated Values (CSV) file, ready to be uploaded directly to a laser ablation system.

The community surrounding TACtool has been growing since it's initial release, as shown by the download metrics from GitHub (\autoref{fig:figure_1}). Many recent changes to the software originate from community feedback, including bug fixes, the addition of the transparent ghost point for easier ROI identification (v1.3.0), and a MacOS version of the software to accommodate a new user base (v1.2.0). This feedback came from GitHub issues and discussions at LA-ICP-MS conferences.

Although TACtool was initially created for geological samples, it has possible applications for many other fields recording ablation sites, such as material science. This wider use is promoted by the fact that TACtool is open source and free to use, making it excellent for any community requiring its use, and enabling individuals to contribute to further features and adapting it for their own specific needs. TACtool offers a laser ablation annotation and coordinate system solution to any community requiring use at no cost and with maximum accessibility in mind, increasing laboratory efficiency, and reproducibility.

We hope that TACtool will save time, lab resources, and money across a variety of fields utilising laser ablation, whilst increasing reproducibility and traceability of their work.
