    abstract={The Campi Flegrei caldera (southern Italy) is one of the most hazardous volcanic systems on Earth, having produced >60 eruptions in the past 15 ka. The caldera remains active and its potential for future eruptions is high, posing a danger to the dense population living nearby. Despite this, our understanding of pre-eruptive processes and the architecture of the sub-volcanic system are poorly constrained. Here, we combine established petrological techniques, geothermobarometric evaluation, and high-resolution trace element crystal mapping, to present a multifaceted, coherent reconstruction of the complex pre-eruptive dynamics and eruption timescales of Astroni volcano located in the eastern sector of Campi Flegrei caldera. The Astroni volcano is an important case study for investigating plumbing system processes and dynamics at Campi Flegrei caldera because it produced the most recent (ca. 4 ka ago) Plinian eruption within the caldera (Astroni 6); current long-term forecasting studies postulate that a similar sized event in this location is a probable future scenario. Geothermobarometric results indicate interaction between an evolved, shallow magma chamber, and a less evolved, deeper pocket of magma, in agreement with previous studies focused on the Astroni 6 eruption products. In addition, a range of textural and trace element zoning patterns point to a complex evolution of both magmas prior to their subsequent interaction. High-resolution trace element crystal maps reveal discrete zonations in compatible elements. These zonations, combined with knowledge of K-feldspar growth rates, highlight a recharge event in the shallow plumbing system a few hours to days before the Astroni 6 eruption.}

    abstract={Complex pyrite textures associated with large changes in isotopic and trace element compositions are routinely assumed to be indicative of multi-faceted processes involving multiple fluid and sulfur sources. We propose that the features of ore-stage pyrite from roll front deposits across the world, revealed in exquisite detail via high-resolution trace element mapping by LA-ICP-MS, reflect the dynamic internal evolution of the biogeochemical processes responsible for sulfate reduction, rather than externally driven changes in fluid or sulfur sources through time. Upon percolation of oxidizing fluids into the reduced host-sandstones, roll front systems become self-organized, with a systematic reset of their activity cycle after each translation stage of the redox interface down dip of the aquifer. Dominantly reducing conditions at the redox interface favor the formation of biogenic framboidal pyrite (δ34S from −30.5 to −12.5‰) by bacterial sulfate reduction and the genesis of the U mineralization. As the oxidation front advances, oxidation of reduced sulfur minerals induces an increased supply of sulfate and metals in solution to the bacterial sulfate reduction zone that has similarly advanced down the flow gradient. Hence, this stage is marked by increased rates of the bacterial sulfate reduction associated with the crystallization of variably As-Co-Ni-Mo-enriched concentric pyrite (up to 10,000′s of ppm total trace contents) with moderately negative δ34S values (from −13.7 to −7.5‰). A final stage of pyrite cement with low trace element contents and heavier δ34S signature (from −6.9 to +18.8‰) marks the end of the roll front activity cycle and the transition from an open to a predominantly closed system behavior (negligible advection of fresh sulfate). Blocky pyrite cement is formed using the remaining sulfate, which now becomes quickly heavy according to a Rayleigh isotope fractionation process. This ends the cycle by depleting the nutrient supplies for the sulfate-reducing bacteria and cementing pore spaces within the host sandstone, effectively restricting fluid infiltration. This internally-driven roll front activity cycle results in systematic, large S isotope and trace element fractionation. Ultimately, the long-time evolution of the basin and fluid sources control the metal endowment and evolution of the system; these events, however, are unlikely to be preserved by the roll front, as a direct result of its hydrodynamic nature.}
